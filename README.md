**Amazon Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard** 📊

Excited to share my latest Power BI project where I explored the Amazon sales data to explore the key insights from the year 2011-2014

🔍 Key takeaways from the dashboard:
💰 Total Revenue: 725K
📈 Profit: 108K
📦 Orders: 1.6K+
🛒 Products Sold: 12K
⏱️ Avg Delivery: 4 days

⚙️ What it shows:
Monthly sales & profit trends (YoY comparison)
Top-performing products & categories
Regional sales distribution
Interactive filters for Year, Month, Product & Location

🧠 Built end-to-end in Power BI, covering data cleaning, DAX measures, and visualization design — aimed to make performance tracking effortless for decision-makers.

Because a dashboard should do more than look good —
 it should shout insights before anyone even asks for them.
