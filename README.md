**Amazon Sales Analysis - Power BI Dashboard** 📊

Excited to share my latest Power BI project where I explored the Amazon sales data to explore the key insights from the year 2011-2014

🔍 Key takeaways from the dashboard:  <br/>
💰 Total Revenue: 725K  <br/>
📈 Profit: 108K  <br/>
📦 Orders: 1.6K+  <br/>
🛒 Products Sold: 12K  <br/>
⏱️ Avg Delivery: 4 days  <br/>

⚙️ What it shows:  <br/>
Monthly sales & profit trends (YoY comparison)  <br/>
Top-performing products & categories  <br/>
Regional sales distribution  <br/>
Interactive filters for Year, Month, Product & Location  <br/>

🧠 Built end-to-end in Power BI, covering data cleaning, DAX measures, and visualization design — aimed to make performance tracking effortless for decision-makers. <br/>

Because a dashboard should do more than look good  <br/>
 it should shout insights before anyone even asks for them.  <br/>
